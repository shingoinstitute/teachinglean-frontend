			<p class="md-body-1"><strong>The Lean Academic Education Network (LEAN)</strong> is an organization whose primary, but not sole, composition is of university educators who are dedicated to the growth of lean research, teaching, and practice. Its purpose is to drive research and thought leadership. Educators draw students together so that LEAN provides a way to attract more people to the efficiency and effectiveness that is at the core of lean thinking and practice. LEAN seeks to actively engage leaders in industry and academe to develop new approaches to teaching university students lean thinking, practices, and action.</p>
			<h2 class="md-headline">Research</h2>
			<p class="md-body-1">With the goal of advancing lean research, education and practice, LEAN has established the <a href="https://fisher.osu.edu/centers-partnerships/coe">College of Operational Excellence</a> (COE) with the <a href="http://www.poms.org/">Production &amp; Operations Management Society</a> (POMS) and anticipates formation of similar linkages with other like-minded professional organizations. In this way LEAN will contribute to both applied and theoretical development of lean enterprise, manufacturing, and service. Among expectations is that research around this development will be routinely presented at the annual POMS Conference or as a coordinated satellite conference, as well as other relevant venues. We further anticipate development of a research journal dedicated to lean and closely aligned topics that will be offered through a respected publisher.</p>
			<p class="md-body-1">As this website is refined, one of its sections will include a list of academic journal that publish lean research and a catalog of pertinent articles. It will also feature a list of award-winning books and articles aimed at academics and practitioners alike. Further, a “call for papers” section of possible interest to scholars interested in presenting their results at conferences and similar events will be maintained. Finally, a director of lean academic researchers will be maintained.</p>
			<h2 class="md-headline">Teaching And Curriculum</h2>
			<p class="md-body-1">This section of the LEAN website will feature teaching modules, case studies, and a syllabus-sharing page where users and find and rate materials for use in classrooms and workshops. Full PowerPoint or PDF lecture files will also be available. </p>
			<h2 class="md-headline">LEAN Dialogue</h2>
			<p class="md-body-1">Members of LEAN will receive announcements about upcoming events where there will be opportunities to meet and dialogue. As this website matures, there will be a more robust discussion forum where members can ask questions and can weigh in on various topics relevant to lean.</p>

			<h2 class="md-display-1 text-align-center">ANNOUNCING THE POMS COLLEGE OF OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE</h2>
			<p class="md-body-1"><b>POMS College of Operational Excellence:</b> Process Improvement is a recurring and, arguably, central theme in operations management. A scan of leading journals, Production & Operations Management Society (POMS) Annual Conferences, and POMS College Mini-Conferences reveals the ubiquity of “improvement” related research, and yet there is no common platform for scholars that study process improvement.  LEAN is pleased to announce the formation of a new College of Operational Excellence (COE) within POMS that aims to create a community of researchers, educators and practitioners who care a common interest in examining how improving processes helps firms achieve superior performance. The COE embraces theoretical and empirical research, irrespective of the organizational context, theoretical approach, or philosophical lens (such as lean production, six sigma, quality management, ISO 9000, among others). The primary objective of the COE is to provide a platform focused on operational excellence to </p>
			<ol>
				<li class="md-body-1">Foster creations and dissemination of scholarly knowledge;</li>
				<li class="md-body-1">Share teaching and pedagogical material;</li>
				<li class="md-body-1">Exchange information about undergraduate, graduate, and other specialized educational program; and</li>
				<li class="md-body-1">Interact with leading practitioners to enrich research and learning.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="md-body-1"><strong>1st Conference of the College of Operational Excellence:</strong> To help advance these goals, the COE will host its inaugural conference at the POMS Annual Conference in Seattle, Washington in May 2017. This POMS mini-conference provides a venue for discussion among those researching operational process improvement to assess the current state of research and teaching, share best practices, and brainstorm new ideas to further promote the field. In addition, attendees will participate in a hands-on activity complete with a case and supporting pedagogical material (teaching note, slide deck) that can be readily deployed in a core or elective operations course.  The inaugural COE mini-conference will be held on from noon to 6pm on Thursday, May 4, 2017, the day prior to the beginning of the POMS Annual Conference.  The mini-conference will be followed by a common reception for all colleges from 6pm to 7:30pm.  Registration for the mini-conference is $100 for members and $50 for student members through April 19th and increases by $25 from April 20th onward. We urge you to attend the mini-conference.</p>
			<p class="md-body-1"><strong>Join the College of Operational Excellence:</strong> All members of POMS are eligible to join the College of Operational Excellence. Please note that one college membership is complementary with POMS membership, with membership fees for additional college being $25 each.</p>
